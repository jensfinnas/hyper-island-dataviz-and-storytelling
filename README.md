# DDS: Data visualization and storytelling

## The assignment

In short: analyze a set of data, find a story, present it.

#### What data?

You will be provided with a couple of datasets from actual clients, but you are free to choose another set of data if you want. If you do so, verify that it meets the course requirements with Jens Finnäs and Thomas Björk before you proceed. You are expected __analyze the data yourselves__ and draw your own conclusions from it.

You are welcome to combine one of the client datasets with other sets of data. 

#### What should the final product look like?

The final product should be some sort of __digital presentation published online__. It can be an interactive application, a static infographic or a video.

The product should stand on it's own. That is, your classmates should be able to look at it an understand it, before you present it to the class.

#### Mid-term and final presentations

We will do mid-term presentations on January 14th. Each group gets 3 minutes to present what they are doing and 10 minutes for discussion.

At this point you should have an idea of what data you want to work with and what story you would like to tell. Use this presentation to get feedback on your work so far and how to proceed.

The final presentations will be on Thursday, January 29th. On Tuesday, January 27th, 23:59 you should submit your work for evaluation by sharing a link. Presentations should be available online.

You will get 15 minutes to present in front of the class, including questions and comments. Be prepared to answer questions such as these:

- What do you want to say?
- What is the purpose?
- Who is the audience?
- What data did you use?
- Why did you choose this form?

#### How will you be evaulated?

You will be peer reviewed by your classmates and get feedback from Jens and Thomas. Our evaluation will revolve around these questions:


- How interesting is your story?
- Does the user get the message? 
- Is the presentation aesthetic and well designed?

Creativity is always highly appreciated.
